This is a Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. The goal is to build a WhatsApp contact center. Please provide code snippets and suggestions that align with this stack. When working with Supabase, assume that the user hasn't set up supabase yet, so make sure you do it for them. Also, ensure that the code is compatible with the latest versions of these technologies. Focus on best practices for performance and maintainability, and provide explanations for complex code snippets to help users understand the implementation.
